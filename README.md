# `DEPLOY_TEST`

A proof-of-concept Postgres extension for maintaining database schemata, as an
extension.

The general process of taking the objects in a database to a new version

Advantages:

-   Proper version control
    -   Deployment by commit, or by tag; e.g. hotfix
    -   Flexible to the semantic versioning scheme relevant to the project.
-   Code generation based on the differences between objects
    -   This applies for rollback, between versions, or arbitary &rsquo;dirty&rsquo; states
        (e.g at development time)
    -   catalog tables contian the necessary information to &rsquo;diff&rsquo;
-   Single source of truth for all declarations and changes to schemata.
-   Automatic test generation for functional, structural, etc tests; using standard
    Postgres test framework.
-   Can be deployed and used on local instances and production instances alike.
-   Tests can be triggered by git hook.

## Workflow


<a id="org82aaf99"></a>

### Extension Install

Installation of the extension follows the standard Postgres Extension install process.

The server will not require a restart after install.

The procedure relies on `gmake`, with tests through `installcheck` managed by
environment variables, as seen below.

For a full list of environment variables relevant to PG, refer the official [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html)

Make the extension available for the instance, generate [results/deploy<sub>test.out</sub>](results/deploy_test.out)
with the following commands &#x2013; and be sure to prepend `sudo` if the installation is
not governed by the executing user.

    make install
    make installcheck -e PGPORT=YOUR_PG_PORT -e PGUSER=YOUR_PG_USER -e OTHERVAR=READ_THE_DOCS

*usr/lib/postgresql/10/lib/pgxs/src/makefiles*../../src/test/regress/pg<sub>regress</sub> &#x2013;inputdir=./ &#x2013;bindir=&rsquo;/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin&rsquo;    &#x2013;dbname=contrib<sub>regression</sub> deploy<sub>test</sub>
(using postmaster on Unix socket, default port)
`============` dropping database &ldquo;contrib<sub>regression</sub>&rdquo; `============`
NOTICE:  database &ldquo;contrib<sub>regression</sub>&rdquo; does not exist, skipping
DROP DATABASE
`============` creating database &ldquo;contrib<sub>regression</sub>&rdquo; `============`
CREATE DATABASE
ALTER DATABASE
`============` running regression test queries        `============`
test deploy<sub>test</sub>              &#x2026; ok

`===================`
 All 1 tests passed. 
`===================`

## Usage

Prepare reference database (all changesets & scripts applied, etc).

Dump the current state of the database; this is the base for the initial commit.

-   The `--clean` option to `pg_dump` will generate a `DROP` statement for each
    object:

    pg_dump --host localhost --port 8432 --dbname "something" --user postgres \
      --schema-only --no-owner --no-privileges  --clean --if-exists \
      | sed -e 's/CREATE TABLE/CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS/g' \
      | grep -v DROP.TABLE > initial-commit-source.sql

-   Adjust the newly created [initial-commit-source.sql](initial-commit-source.sql) according to your needs.

-   Create the test suite in [sql/](sql/) as demonstrated.

-   Run the tests, with copy step to expected
    
        make install
        make installcheck -e PGPORT=YOUR_PG_PORT -e PGUSER=YOUR_PG_USER -e OTHERVAR=READ_THE_DOCS
        cp results/deploy_test.out expected/deploy_test.out
        make installcheck -e PGPORT=YOUR_PG_PORT -e PGUSER=YOUR_PG_USER -e OTHERVAR=READ_THE_DOCS

-   Save the state (e.g. git commit / tag) if tests pass.

NOTE: If structural changes against the **current** version exist in the database,
      it should be possible to write the version held by the extension to a new
      schema that is not owned by the extension. From here, the process above
      can be followed to get a new baseline.

## Troubleshooting

### `installcheck`: `psql: FATAL:  role "root" does not exist`

By default, the user/role mapping will be used when attempting to establish a
connection to the target database.

If `installcheck` has been run as `sudo make installcheck`, then the associated
`PGUSER` that will be attempted with login will be `root`, which is not
typically set up on the database server.

To fix, supply the `PGUSER` environment variable to `make` with the `-e` option:

    sudo make installcheck -e PGUSER='<user>'

If you get an error regarding peer authentication, refer [1.5.2](#org1e98693)


<a id="org1e98693"></a>

### `installcheck`: `psql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user "<USER>"`

This error will likely arise when running `make installcheck` with supplying
environment variable `PGUSER`.
The fix for this depends on the authentication configuration of the target instance;

-   ascertain how authentication is configured by finding `pg_hba.conf` &#x2013; this
    can generally be found at `/etc/postgresql/<VERSION>/main/pg_hba.conf`;
    replace `<VERSION>` with the applicable version
-   so, either:
    -   change local login (first entry) from `peer` to `md5` or any other relevant
        auth method;
        -   `md5` allows for password auth from the user&rsquo;s UNIX login
        -   `trust` will just allow any arbitrary local connections
    
    -   check your environment variables to `make installlcheck`, and adjust the
        parameters given to suit your auth config; e.g. `PGPASSWORD` as the
        substitute for the connection parameter for `password`
-   if necessary, reload the server to apply the auth changes with the following
    command
    
        /etc/init.d/postgresql reload
